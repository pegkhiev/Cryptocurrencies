## The Project 

1) Data Preprocessing:
The dataset has been pre-processed by removing data that doesn't add value in the machine learning model, and then scaled to standardize all data using Standard Scaler from sklearn. 

2) PCA 
The data dimensions are reduced using PCA to three dimensions. 

3) Clustering using K-means 
Based on the elbow curve, the optimal number of clusters chosen was 4.
The new dataframe with the class was created. 

4) Visualizing Results
- The 3D plot was created 
- The new HVplot table was created 
- The scatter plot with x = Total Coins Mined and y = Total Coin Supply was created.
